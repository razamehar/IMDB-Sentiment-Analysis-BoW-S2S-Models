# IMDB Sentiment Analysis using various Bag-of-Words and Sequence to Sequence Models

## Project Overview
This project contains a comprehensive sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. It employs various machine learning techniques, including both Bag of Words models and Sequence to Sequence models, to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The Bag of Words models implemented include a Unigram model, which considers individual words as features; a Bigram model, which considers pairs of consecutive words; a Trigram model, which considers triplets of consecutive words; and a Bigram model enhanced with TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency). The Sequence to Sequence models encompass several approaches: one-hot encoded vectors, which provide a simple representation of words; word embeddings and pretrained embeddings using GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation); and transformers with positional embeddings, which represent state-of-the-art techniques in natural language processing. Additionally, a comparison of the accuracy of these models on test data is conducted and assessed, providing insights into their performance and effectiveness in sentiment classification. This diverse set of models allows for a thorough exploration of sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset.
